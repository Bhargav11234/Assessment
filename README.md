# DSA ASSESSMENT

###  Subarray and String Problems

1. **Find a Subarray with a Given Sum**
   - Given an array of integers and a target, return the starting and ending indices of a subarray that sums to the target.

2. **Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters**
   - Use the Brute Force Approach  to find the length of the longest substring with at most `K` distinct characters.

###  Linked List Problems

3. **Reverse Nodes in K-Group**
   - Reverse nodes of a linked list in groups of `k`. Handle cases where remaining nodes are fewer than `k`.

4. **Merge Multiple Sorted Linked Lists**
   - Merge an array of sorted linked lists into one sorted list using an optimal approach (e.g., min-heap).


###  Tree and Graph Problems

5. **Build and Query a Trie (Prefix Tree)**
   - Implement insert, search, and prefix query operations in a trie.

6. **Find the Diameter of a Binary Tree**
   - Calculate the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a binary tree.

7. **Detect Cycles in a Directed Graph**
   - Use depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles in a directed graph.

### Greedy and Dynamic Programming

8. **Connect Ropes with Minimum Cost**
   - Combine ropes to minimize total cost using a priority queue.

9. **Longest Palindromic Subsequence**
   - Find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string using dynamic programming.
